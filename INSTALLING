Dependencies for Fedora (Gnome):
qt-x11
qt-devel
phonon
phonon-devel
phonon-backend-gstreamer
gstreamer
gcc
gcc-c++
gstreamer-plugins-ugly (in rpmfusion, mp3 support)

Dependencies for Ubuntu (Gnome):
build-essential
libphonon-dev
libqt4-core
libqt4-gui
libqt4-dev
phonon
phonon-backend-xine 

I couldn't get gstreamer to work, although it did work on Fedora
Tested on Ubuntu 9.04 in VirtualBox 2.2.0

Dependencies for KDE:
Qt 4.4 or newer, if not 4.5
Phonon is not supported in anything older than 4.4.  
This also applies to Gnome.

I use KDE 4.2.2 with Qt 4.5, so that would be the most tested configuration. ;)
