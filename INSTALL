CMake is required to build kajammer.

Dependencies for Fedora (Gnome):
qt-x11
qt-devel
phonon
phonon-devel
phonon-backend-gstreamer

I couldn't get gstreamer to work, although it did work on Fedora

Dependencies for KDE:
Qt 4.4 or newer
Phonon is not supported in anything older than 4.4.  
This also applies to Gnome.

How to install:
./configure

The command kajammer  opens kajammer
Kajammer can be found in the Gnome or KDE System menu under Multimedia or Audio/Video, etc
