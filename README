Currently, only Linux is supported by me.  You can try to run Kajammer on OS X or Windows, but I have not tested those platforms, and I don't really plan to.  The only Linux specific thing I use is the unistd.h header, which is part of GNU, and I use it for my Cli interface.  So I don't see why it wouldn't run on OS X or Windows, just don't bet on it.
 
See INSTALLING for dependencies.

To build:
-Change directory to where you downloaded KaJammer
- ./configure
- qmake
- make
- sudo make install
- Use the command kajammer to run

To switch to the unstable branch:
1.  Check out the current branches:
    git branch -r
2.  Switch to the desired branch:
    git checkout -b yourBranchName -t origin/myRemoteBranch
    Where yourBranchName is anything you want, and myRemoteBranch is the name of the remote branch.

Check out the kajamtag branch.
Kajamtag is an MP3/Ogg tag reader written in C (by me)
I never really liked Phonon's tag reading capabilities, so I wrote my own.
Kajamtag is still very unstable, and Kajammer may segfault on you while using it.

Get kajamtag:
git clone git://github.com/pvtcupcakes/kajamtag.git

Just run make and make install on kajamtag and it should be ready for kajammer to use
