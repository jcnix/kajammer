Currently, only Linux is supported by me.  You can try to run Kajammer on OS X or Windows, but I have not tested those platforms, and I don't really plan to.  The only Linux specific thing I use is the unistd.h header, which is part of GNU, and I use it for my Cli interface.  So I don't see why it wouldn't run on OS X or Windows, just don't bet on it.

See INSTALLING for dependencies.

To build:
-Change directory to where you downloaded KaJammer
-Run qmake
-Run make
-sudo make install
-Use the command kajammer to run

To switch to the unstable branch:
1.  Check out the current branches:
    git branch -r
2.  Switch to the desired branch:
    git checkout -b yourBranchName -t origin/myRemoteBranch
    Where yourBranchName is anything you want, and myRemoteBranch is the name of the remote branch.
