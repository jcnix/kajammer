Currently, only Linux is supported by me.  You can try to run Kajammer on OS X or Windows, but I have not tested those platforms, and I don't really plan to.  The only Linux specific thing I use is the unistd.h header, which is part of GNU, and I use it for my Cli interface.  So I don't see why it wouldn't run on OS X or Windows, just don't bet on it.
 
See INSTALLING for dependencies.

To build:
-Change directory to where you downloaded KaJammer
-Run qmake
-Run make
-Run qmake
-sudo make install
-Use the command kajammer to run

There is a bug with qmake and it's not generating the makefile correctly, so it won't install the compiled binary unless you run qmake again since the binary didn't exist before you compiled.

To switch to the unstable branch:
1.  Check out the current branches:
    git branch -r
2.  Switch to the desired branch:
    git checkout -b yourBranchName -t origin/myRemoteBranch
    Where yourBranchName is anything you want, and myRemoteBranch is the name of the remote branch.
